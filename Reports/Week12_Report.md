## Retrospective
1. Appreciation: Brian creating a Deliverable 7 sign-up document to clearly understand the goal of each section in Deliverable 7 and what each person is expected to do.
2. Successes: We were able to implement a way around having a in-person meeting by signing up in Brian's document and working on our own section on Report 12.
3. Failures: Unfortunately, we didn't hold a team meeting due to other team projects for other classes.
4. Barriers: We are in the final stretch of the semester, where everyone is busy with other classes, as well as studying for finals.
5. What we should try next time:
