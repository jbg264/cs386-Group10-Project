## Retrospective
1. Appreciation: Brian Dorame creating a "sign up" document to organize the team's contribution for the upcoming Deliverable
   
2. Successes: Everybody is present in the meeting.
   
4. Failures: We failed to show up in-person in the booked library room due to snow fall.
   
6. Barriers: Everybody is busy with other classes, especially with those with upcoming exams for other classes
   
8. What we should try next time: Observing how helpful the "task" document is to the team, we may use it again for the upcoming Deliverables.
