## Project Idea:

* Randomizer for Games / Movies
* Stat Trackers for any small audience
* RSVP Application for events
* Calendar Applications
* Card Games

  Chosen Potential Ideas: Stat Tracker, Exercise Tracker
  Talent: CSS, HTML, C, and Python

  Details about Project:
    We will create a web based tracker that falls under the tracker categories.
  There will be small "achievements" used to motivate the user to continue excercising.
  The user will manually input how long they've been excercising for and the software
  will be able to calculate how much calories they lost and reserve that data within its
  database. The user can input how much calories they've eaten in the past day, so they are
  aware how much calories they may need to burn. If the user is able to keep excercising and
  continue interacting with the website, it'll reward the user with achievements. Plus, all the
  data will be held under an account created by the user.
