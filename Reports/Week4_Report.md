## Retrospective
1. Appreciation: Our team was able to get an idea and understand the required tasks we were supposed to do for the upcoming Deliverable. Hence, able to work on it early than doing it last minute
2. Successes: Able to resort to meeting up through discord to successfully continue interacting with the group members. We were able to accommodate to more group members due to busy schedules as well
3. Failures: The initial plan was to send a draft to the Teacher’s Assistant by Saturday, but due to other conflicting plans on Saturday. We weren't able to. Weren’t able to do an extra Saturday meeting.
4. Barriers: Had a snowstorm during Friday, hindering the chances of meeting in the library. 
5. What we should try next time: What we should try next time: We will plan a solid schedule to create “office” hours on weekends/weekdays to help missing participants catch up on the project.
