## Retrospective
1. **Appreciation**:  A teammate who brought up the topic of Midterms and began to strategically discuss how we’ll do Midterms (made process with it)
2. **Successes**: Based on prior experience with Deliverable 2 and Weekly Reports, we’ve decided to look into the important sections of the next deliverable and the Midterm to better prepare ourselves.
3. **Failures**: We still had a missing group member, which was not a big issue or unexpected this week, but meetings are a priority for this planning phase.
4. **Barriers**:  We are trying to overcome the challenge of teammates doing their individual part from deliverable
5. **What we should try next time**: We will try to change the usual meetings to see how it works and how productive the individuals may be.
