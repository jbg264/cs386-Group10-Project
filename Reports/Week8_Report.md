## Retrospective
1. Appreciation: Brian Dorame created a base code to start the implementation off, making it more lenient on other teammates.
2. Successes: Our team has successfully divided the code and were able to organize which is the most important implementation
3. Failures: We started locking in on the project more later than it should have.
4. Barriers: One of the barriers we are facing is how we, as a team, are going to organize and finish Deliverable 4 by Saturday.
5. What we should try next time: We should've had a 30 minute meeting / small meeting to understand and better prepare for Deliverable 4.
