### Introduction: 
Film Haven is a streaming entertainment website that allows indie film enthusiasts to easily watch the most recent and popular indie films created by independent creators, prioritizing the customer needs by curating the website to their interests and encouraging community engagement.  By visiting Film Haven, users can experience innovative films and support small movie businesses and independent creators. Film Haven is a indie movie review website that allows film enthusiasts and aspiring indie filmmakers to discover, showcase, and review unique and compelling indie films. 

The system must support user account creation and management, allowing users to securely register, login, and update their bio and favorite genres. Publishers update their profile to include the bio, genre specialization and website link and need a simple process to submit their movie for assessment by admins, ensuring it is following platform guidelines. The system must also provide personalized recommendation generated from the user's favorite genres to help the user discover new indie films based on their viewing history and preferences. Additonallly, users should be able to create and manage Watchlists and mark films as Favorites for easy access. The platform must include a review system, allowing users to add ratings and comments to movies, creating community engagement through comments and interactions. Admins must have the tools to review and approve film submissions and ban users to regulate platform rules. Finally, movies should be easily searched for by the user, using various criteria such as genre, year, rating, and title, allowing for a seamless and engaging experience for all stakeholders.
