### UX Design:
The design approach we did for our user interface was simplicity and easy accessbility. We wanted our users to easily go through our site and know about it is about without overwhelming them. We add eye-popping aesthetics that grab the user's attention and directs them to places we want them to show. This includes our film of the week or any potential film news. The user interface is very responsive and smooth throughout the website and allows for easy traversal between pages. Certain titles/sections will use different colors to distinguish themselves from the sections around them. We attempt to use a cinema aesthetic with the images we used, corresponding with the idea of our website.

### Lessons Learned:
One of the problems we had with this project was trying to merge between many different branches. We had to split out work between many people, causing us to creating many branches and pull requests, therefore, creating slight confusion on what can access what. This was quickly resolved as we learned more about github and its features, while communicating between each other. Another problem was doing this all relatively last minute. Despite coming up the features beforehand and communicating our parts, we still turned in this deliverabled pretty last minute. For the 2nd release, we will regulate our time more efficiently and effectively. We will learn more about the programs and environments we use and communicate to each other thoroughly to get project done.
<!--

Criteria (2pts):
  Adequate reflection abt problems & solutions, clear description w/ adequate use of language.
