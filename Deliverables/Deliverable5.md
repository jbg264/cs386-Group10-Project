### Description: 
Film Haven is a streaming platform for movie lovers and aspiring filmmakers, featuring original, experimental films by independent creators where each user can create an account for a viewer or a producer, a home page to allow you to browse indie movies, profile page customization, and the ability to create and share reviews.

This website focuses on community engagement and this is shown through the reviews given to each film, and allowing comments on each one to give critique and conversation. It also allows viewers to discuss new material they have never seen before through recommendations based on their most recently viewed, and through the special feature of short of the month.
